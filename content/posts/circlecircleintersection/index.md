We look at computing the area of intersection of two circles (see Figure 1). This problem seems like it should be almost trivial. However, there are some corner cases to handle that are not immediately obvious (at least to me). Googling for this has brought me to several partial results that do not account for all the corner cases, so here is hopefully a post that is complete and can be referenced in the future to be able to quickly implement this computation. Hopefully, this post will not <a href="https://xkcd.com/927/" target="_blank"> cause any further confusion</a>.
